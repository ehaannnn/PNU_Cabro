Anyone who&amp;#39;s seen Manchester by the Sea knows that this guy has acting chops, and they are on full display here, if briefly. Rooney Mara steals the show though. Her portrait of grief and journey to let go of the past is nothing short of exquisite. I really wish this film had a wider release in the fall so that Mara and the film itself would stand a better chance of getting the award recognition they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinematography:&lt;/strong&gt; This movie is gorgeous. It is full of many shots that linger for long periods of time almost to the point where they make the viewer unconformable. As such, the framing of these shots is exceptionally important, and film does not disappoint. From long shots of the ghost walking through a field, to meandering shots of tree branches in front of an overcast sky, to shots of the haunted house with the ghost in the window, this film does an excellent job of establishing an eerie tone through its cinematography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing:&lt;/strong&gt; This film is stylistically edited in a way I have never seen before. As the story of the movie takes place over a long period of time, you&amp;#39;ll have scenes where a cut back and forth between two characters will show a large quantity of time elapsed, just by outfits and seasons changing. Moreover, you&amp;#39;ll have scenes where the passage of time is shown by characters seemingly teleporting around to different parts of the house. The way the shots of this movie are cut literally make it seem as if time is flying by in the blink of an eye. This is in stark contrast to certain scenes in the movie that dwell on one moment for ages. This makes the structure of the film come together as a montage of moments, which in turn parallels the story and life generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music:&lt;/strong&gt; The ability of music, and art in general, to leave its mark on this world beyond the life of its creator is one of the main themes of the film. As such, music plays a large driving force in the movie. The song that Affleck&amp;#39;s character writes (the one from the trailer) is fantastic, and I&amp;#39;ve listened to it multiple time since seeing the movie. The score of the movie is wonderful too though. Pieces range from dreary and melancholy to dour and frightening. A piece of Beethoven plays over a character&amp;#39;s speech - the speech itself about Beethoven - in a way that perfectly meshes sound to story. With minimal dialogue the score to the film is has to act as a character itself, and the music here works amazingly in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plot:&lt;/strong&gt; The plot is maybe one of the weaker aspects of the film, if you hold it to traditional story telling standards. The story can loosely be described as a series of events that happen in one location over the course of many, many years through the eyes of a ghost. There&amp;#39;s is a bit of conflict with Mara&amp;#39;s character learning to let go of her past, and a bit of resolution with the ghost as well, but in general the plot here is pretty abstract, and intentionally so. If you go in expecting to view the movie more like a painting in an art gallery, you&amp;#39;ll be more willing to forgive the lack of a typical story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characters:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, this is a potential criticism of the movie. The characters of the film are intentionally not that fleshed out. The two main leads are little more developed than a boy and girl who are in love with each other. There&amp;#39;s a bit more motivation to them than that, but it&amp;#39;s not clear whether further characterization is even needed. Whether leaving them as blank slates adds or subtracts to the artistry of the film is up for debate, but with a ~90 minute run time there was certainly room to develop them a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the wall of text, but I liked this film so much that I had to get my thoughts on it written down. If you are near a theater playing it, and at all have the patience for thoughtful dramas, I would urge you to give A Ghost Story a viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; A Ghost Story is a slow-paced, but beautiful movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I won't bury the lead - **A Ghost Story is in my opinion the best film to come out all year, and might even be one of my favorite films of all time.** \n\nNow some caveats to that bold statement.
