the emotions Mr. Cage can coax from even the most closed hearted people like me, (I didn&amp;#39;t even cry during tho notebook so don&amp;#39;t call me soft or some shit bro). Right from the beginning of the movie Nick has a great performance of a hardened war veteran with a soft spot for his wife. When men in the bar begin harassing her Nicholas shows us with an immense amount of acting ability just how unstable his character is as he is about to attack the man and his wife just barely manages to stop him but later when he is entering his car his protectiveness truly does show as he goes out of his way to protect his wife from the 3 men that were harassing her using his deadly martial arts that he learnt during his time in the us rangers. This love for his family will cause problems for him again later in the movie and this is an excellent example of foreshadowing and Nick keeps it just barely vague enough to make it seem like it was just a one off incident but later in the movie when billy bedlam has Casey&amp;#39;s bunny Nick loses it and kills the man simply for trying to stop him from delivering a present to his daughter but I&amp;#39;m getting ahead of myself there is much more to talk about earlier in the movie, throughout the movie we see Cameron Poe  (Cage&amp;#39;s character) being remarkably snarky to everyone on the plane except for when his family comes up the second they are mentioned Cage becomes silent, in a very malicious kind of way like he&amp;#39;s giving the person a moment to reconsider what they had said to him, once again reaffirming the notion that Poe is very protective of his family and wants nothing more than to return to them. Another main character Baby-o is the only other person besides his family ( and later, air Marshall larkins) that Cameron cares about and/or trusts.

This love for his family will cause problems for him again later in the movie and this is an excellent example of foreshadowing and Nick keeps it just barely vague enough to make it seem like it was just a one off incident but later in the movie when billy bedlam has Casey's bunny Nick loses it and kills the man simply for trying to stop him from delivering a present to his daughter but I'm getting ahead of myself there is much more to talk about earlier in the movie, throughout the movie we see Cameron Poe  (Cage's character) being remarkably snarky to everyone on the plane except for when his family comes up the second they are mentioned Cage becomes silent, in a very malicious kind of way like he's giving the person a moment to reconsider what they had said to him, once again reaffirming the notion that Poe is very protective of his family and wants nothing more than to return to them. Another main character Baby-o is the only other person besides his family ( and later, air Marshall larkins) that Cameron cares about and/or trusts. Nick conveys raw emotion through the screen straight into our hearts in the scenes where baby-o is hurting from not having his insulin and Nick goes out of his way to do anything to help out his celly, showing that his character while prone to lashing out is a kind but skeptical man at heart, while I would love to go even more in depth of how amazing of a performance Nicholas Cage puts on during this movie, I've already spent to long writing this and I've got to go watch the wicker man again, until my next post, goodbye fellow movie watchers and have a wonderful day.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Review", "id": "6qky0g", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FullRageQuit", "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.movies", "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "review", "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6qky0g/an_in_depth_look_at_the_masterful_performance_of/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "name": "t3_6qky0g", "created": 1501488962.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6qky0g/an_in_depth_look_at_the_masterful_performance_of/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "An in depth look at the masterful performance of Nicholas Cage in Con Air (1997)", "created_utc": 1501460162.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "ups": 0, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "is_video": false, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "movies", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just finished watching the David Fincher movies I hadn&amp;#39;t previously seen, and he has now earned his place as one of my favourite directors.

The two movies that I wanna see the most out of those that I haven\u2019t seen yet are *Dunkirk* and *War for the Planet of the Apes* (and of course, *The Emoji Movie* /s) and I only have time to see one of them. I\u2019ve heard they are both very good films which makes the decision between them even harder. I also ask for no one to post spoilers (yes, even for *Dunkirk* which is about a real event).\n\nEdit:\nI think I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019ll see Dunkirk, especially since I\u2019ve realized I live very close to one of the showings of Dunkirk in IMAX 70mm.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Question", "id": "6qj58d", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Austinator224", "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.movies", "hidden": false, "num_comments": 23, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "edited": 1501460150.0, "link_flair_css_class": "quickquestion", "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6qj58d/what_movie_should_i_go_see_dunkirk_or_war_for_the/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "name": "t3_6qj58d", "created": 1501470020.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6qj58d/what_movie_should_i_go_see_dunkirk_or_war_for_the/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "What movie should I go see? \u201cDunkirk\u201d or \u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes?\u201d NO SPOILERS!", "created_utc": 1501441220.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "ups": 0, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "is_video": false, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "movies", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, a Lynch- Tarantiono horror/ slasher/ serial killer movie would be epic according to me.

Witness does almost everything just a little better, and without a gimmick. On top of that, the dialogue in Witness is just so witty and funny (especially in the first 40 or so minutes), and delivered so expertly by Charles Laughton.
