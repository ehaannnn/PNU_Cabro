It feels more original even than the first movie.\n\n\nhttp://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/doug-liman/51049/doug-liman-interview-the-wall-bourne-edge-of-tomorrow-2", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Article", "id": "6q6pct", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wile__E__Coyote", "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 256, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.movies", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Uj416514r-p2MUzUko7EuMctPur56iWKr3FTS4okC4g.jpg?s=84d3fa3f6856c074a3eb96b28cf7efcd", "width": 2048, "height": 1354}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Uj416514r-p2MUzUko7EuMctPur56iWKr3FTS4okC4g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=9e2d3dde7a1ab401b9ea85ef54048aaf", "width": 108, "height": 71}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Uj416514r-p2MUzUko7EuMctPur56iWKr3FTS4okC4g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=f79049b6152e95f72f18ecb67dda2ea9", "width": 216, "height": 142}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Uj416514r-p2MUzUko7EuMctPur56iWKr3FTS4okC4g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=a4a272b47a4b134eb5c94ac140fe76b8", "width": 320, "height": 211}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Uj416514r-p2MUzUko7EuMctPur56iWKr3FTS4okC4g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=79b26d07de4dd63ca99a9d816d2abd34", "width": 640, "height": 423}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Uj416514r-p2MUzUko7EuMctPur56iWKr3FTS4okC4g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=93b453159c129b626d25b182fc1b9917", "width": 960, "height": 634}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Uj416514r-p2MUzUko7EuMctPur56iWKr3FTS4okC4g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=85160ffa721c104a73a06b07a5f492af", "width": 1080, "height": 714}], "variants": {}, "id": "Mhc9-nf0aBTmZlbOd4bMQ99Px78i-iBsRUolmH7HpHg"}], "enabled": false}, "num_comments": 135, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "article", "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6q6pct/doug_liman_on_edge_of_tomorrow_and_sequel_title/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "name": "t3_6q6pct", "created": 1501304226.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6q6pct/doug_liman_on_edge_of_tomorrow_and_sequel_title/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Doug Liman on Edge of Tomorrow and sequel title: \"when we make the sequel, [the original will be] permanently titled Live Die Repeat.

great. when i watched it it was a beautiful experience for me i won&amp;#39;t say if i watched the same movie with knowing much stuff i would have hated it but you can&amp;#39;t beat the experience

There's usually some kind of vaguely ominous music playing loudly in the background (the one I caught a glimpse of at the gym today used Thievery Corporation's \"Indra\".) There are sound effects of gun clips and zippo lighters, but no dialogue during these scenes, and all the guys will have a blank \"IDGAF\" kind of look on their faces. (Well, since they're usually striding towards a room they're about to shoot up.)\n\nI seem to think this trope originated in spaghetti Westerns, though I couldn't say which. Reservoir Dogs contains at least one of them, but as anyone hip knows, every shot Tarantino uses is a reference to something earlier.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [],

class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of you are still wondering why all the die-hard, life-long fans of the Dark Tower books have a problem with the way this property and film has been handled.....think of it this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go back to the year 1999 and you&amp;#39;ve just heard that Peter Jackson is going to be doing a multi-film, star-studded, big-budget, multi-Oscar worthy, live action &amp;#39;Lord of the Rings&amp;#39; on the big screen. One epic film for each of the three books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of millions of fans over many decades are overjoyed and are already planning when to camp out in front of the movie theatre. They are salivating at the idea of eventually spending whole pay-checks on action figures, tattoos, cross country Comic-Cons, LOTR themed weddings, card games, board games, video games, cosplay, DVDs, lunch boxes, Halloween costumes for their kids, etc. It&amp;#39;s going to be absolute LOTR fan &amp;#39;heaven&amp;#39; for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A life-long dream is coming true for every LOTR fan on the planet. Everything is right with the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But suddenly, after years of amazing LOTR movie news, in the background there have been so many problems, arguments, fired writers, multiple directors, delays, re-writes, &amp;#39;money&amp;#39; people at all stages of the production coming in and going (etc), that the studio has lost almost all confidence. They have now only given Jackson a $60 million production budget instead of the ~$300 million he needed, with barely any cash set aside for marketing. Jackson has had to completely compromise his original vision and hack up the screenplay to something unrecognizable to himself, the author of the source material and the fans. It might as well be a music video version of the Lord of the Rings starring the Beatles and directed by Stanley Kubrick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve now made it one, single film and a &amp;#39;sequel&amp;#39; to LOTR....which is actually just a lame excuse for a significantly shortened &amp;#39;retelling&amp;#39;, pretending to be the central story on a shoe-string budget, so it at least &amp;#39;resembles&amp;#39; a LOTR movie. But just barely enough to hopefully get away with it. As long as it has a Hobbit, a ring and a volcano in it, it&amp;#39;s really all we need. Screw the rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The amazing series of LOTR films we were promised is now only one film and only 95 minutes long.....with completely the wrong film rating. Which includes ~10 minutes of credits. Making it only ~85 mins long. That&amp;#39;s right, only 1 hour and 25 mins long. Less than an hour and a half to encapsulate the overall plot, spirit, depth and emotion of three of the world&amp;#39;s most amazing fantasy novels. True genius. Sure to be a crowd pleaser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;#39;ve cast Aragorn as a Black TV actor because (while a truly great TV actor) he was far less expensive than other more qualified big-screen actors that would actually fit the character as originally written, and do the character and the story justice. Peter obviously needs to watch the wallet, but he&amp;#39;s sure the fans will be fine with changing such a crucial part of the story without asking a single one of the fans for an opinion first (like most film-makers handling iconic properties would do). He obviously knows better than hundreds of millions of fans worldwide and knows better than the amazing source material that got him the job in the first place. Who cares about the fans, or indeed a key, crucial part of the source material that has a huge impact on all the books, right? It&amp;#39;s only the Lord of the Rings after all. It&amp;#39;s not like anyone cares or that it will limit anything in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve also had to cut out key characters like Gandalf, Bilbo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gollum, Saruman, Grima, Galadriel, Celeborn, Theoden (and family), Treebeard, Elrond, Gimli, Legolas, Boromir, Faramir and Denethor ....and many others. They all fell victim to budget cuts and the compacted run-time. But don&amp;#39;t worry, no one should miss them because they aren&amp;#39;t part of our amazing &amp;#39;re-imagining&amp;#39; / &amp;#39;sequel&amp;#39;. Hobbit+ring+volcano. Job jobbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Nothing to see here......move along).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Peter Jackson knows very well, that if this film flops (financially, critically or both), that the fans likely won&amp;#39;t see a faithful adaption of the Lord of the Rings for another 10, 15 maybe 20 years. No one will dare touch this property until the stench of Peter&amp;#39;s mess fades away. Many of the original fans from 1984 could be long gone by then. But hey, they&amp;#39;re just responsible for the success of the franchise and the reason the film gets to be made in the first place. So really, who cares?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Jackson still sells his soul for the quick cash and at the same time sells out the fans who believed in him. He sold out instead holding out, being patient and getting it done right, even though he&amp;#39;s repeatedly claimed for years to be the most faithful LOTR fan that ever lived. Way to stay classy Pete. In Peter Jackson we trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they&amp;#39;ve skipped most of the content, characters and detailed plot of all three LOTR books and just mashed up a few iconic catch-phrases and &amp;#39;scenes&amp;#39;, kept a few character names, tied them together in a script, shot it in South Africa instead of New Zealand, added a bunch of stuff that was never in the books to begin with, used some poor CGI and called it (tongue-in-cheek) &amp;#39;The Lord of the Rings&amp;#39;. They go from Bag End to Mount Doom (&amp;#39;and back again&amp;#39;) in only three acts and an hour and a half. The magic of Hollywood and just not giving a fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new compacted plot in the &amp;#39;sequel&amp;#39; is that they simply fly the &amp;#39;One Ring&amp;#39; the whole way from Hobbiton to Mount Doom (and back) on Eagles, with a couple of pit stops, set pieces and action sequences along the way that those pesky &amp;#39;fans&amp;#39; will recognize in the trailer. So they should still buy a ticket, hope for the best and be grateful they are getting a LOTR film at all. Why are they so upset? The studio is perplexed, because in their mind they and Peter Jackson are obviously doing the fans a favor by just getting out of bed in the morning at this stage. Fans are so needy sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, they&amp;#39;ve cast \u2018big-name\u2019 Matthew McConaughey as their new and improved version of Sauron (that average film-goers, millennials and kids can better identify with). JRR Tolkien has risen from the grave, winked, given it two thumbs up and told them where to send his royalty check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this &amp;#39;sequel&amp;#39; should obviously be embraced with open arms by the many millions of fans who grew up loving the books over the past ~63 years. The film is still called &amp;#39;The Lord of the Rings&amp;#39;, so they should have nothing to be concerned with or complain about. Right? We know we&amp;#39;ve fucked the LOTR fans over, but they just need to get over it and get in line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and on the microscopic chance this film goes well, we might get an ongoing Hobbit &amp;#39;prequel&amp;#39; TV series based on this completely different &amp;#39;retelling / sequel&amp;#39; where they&amp;#39;ll milk a single book over a number of years for all it&amp;#39;s worth for the advertising revenue and paid streaming / downloads. If they can squeeze the &amp;#39;flavor&amp;#39; of three massive iconic books into only 85 minutes, it should be a piece of cake to stretch out a totally different version &amp;#39;The Hobbit&amp;#39; across 7 or 8 seasons of television. Easy money. Just close your eyes, bend over, spread your cheeks, no lube, smile and think of the Shire. The studio and Peter Jackson are comin&amp;#39; in dry and deep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now....lifelong Tolkien fans worldwide are feeling violated without so much as a reach-around. They feel crushed, outraged and they die a little inside with every new lame excuse, disappointing announcement, sad press release, lackluster interview with the demotivated cast, badly Photoshopped poster and rushed trailer that gets shat out of this horror show. And Peter Jackson is now so far gone and out of touch, that he just can&amp;#39;t understand why this is an issue. Or he does understand and just doesn&amp;#39;t give a shit anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck the source material, fuck my credibility, fuck my scruples, fuck the Oscars and fuck the fans. I&amp;#39;ve clearly never even read the books. Just pay me.&amp;quot; - Peter Jackson \n.\n.\n.\nTHAT, is the Dark Tower film we are getting, and THAT&amp;#39;s how badly this property has been treated and shamefully squandered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOTE: If any of that needs translation, that actually is the long history and more recent demise of the Dark Tower film. And for the purposes of this analogy : LOTR = The Dark Tower, Aragorn = Roland the Gunslinger, 3 LOTR Books = 7 Dark Tower Books, The Hobbit = Wizard and Glass, Tolkien = Stephen King, and Peter Jackson = Ron Howard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And just in case any of the long time film-buffs out there haven&amp;#39;t noticed, this Dark Tower &amp;#39;sequel&amp;#39; for some unknown reason (instead of keeping the overall plot of the books or something that even resembles it), now has almost the exact same plot as the 1987 He-Man - Masters of the Universe film with Dolph Lundgren and [pre-Friends] Courtney Cox. And it&amp;#39;s also almost identical to the plot of the Last Action Hero with Schwarzenegger from 1993.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just done in a cheaply replicated &amp;#39;Dark Tower style&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If all of this doesn&amp;#39;t make it clear for you how bad this is and why the life-long fans aren&amp;#39;t happy with it, nothing will.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "If any of you are still wondering why all the die-hard, life-long fans of the Dark Tower books have a problem with the way this property and film has been handled.....think of it this way.\n\nGo back to the year 1999 and you've just heard that Peter Jackson is going to be doing a multi-film, star-studded, big-budget, multi-Oscar worthy, live action 'Lord of the Rings' on the big screen.
